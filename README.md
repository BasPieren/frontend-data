## To Do 📌
This is a list of things in want to do in this project:
- [X] Git, npm, and d3 are used; the project runs without errors; data is loaded with d3; there is a representation of data
- [X] Data is rendered with d3; interpreting the representation is easier that interpreting the data itself
- [ ] d3 is used to clean data and make an interactive representation; Data is transformed
- [ ] Representation and use of a d3 go beyond an example: there are demonstrable additions like well-chosen interaction methods
- [ ] The way the student applies subject matter is more advanced than what they were taught in class; let’s switch places

## Description 📝
During this project I used the d3 javascript library to make a interactive data presentation using data from the OBA API. I looked for interesting patterns of books about World War II.
